# Live Cinema Coding 
### Ussing **Tidal Cycles**, **Processing** and **Unreal Engine**
##### by **Malitzin Cortes (CNDSD)** and **Ivan Abreu**

We define Live Cinema Coding as a performative practice (heir to Live cinema) that uses live coding to
sequence cinematographic shots, transform a 3D scene, animate actors, control light, process videos, etc.
We use the pattern strength of Tidal to create sound-visual synesthesia and music visualization by refactoring
musical patterns into visual patterns.



### 1. Tidal Cycles
<a href="https://tidalcycles.org/" target="_blank">Tidal Cycles</a> is a free/open source software, that allows you to make patterns with code, whether live coding music at algoraves or composing in the studio, created by Alex McLean.

### 2. Processing
<a href="https://processing.org/download" target="_blank">Processing</a> is a free/open source software, very flexible and focus mostly in interactive visual arts. In this case es used as a bridget between Tidal Cycles and Unreal Engine.

### 3. Unreal Engine
<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download" target="_blank">Unreal Engine</a> is a game engine for 3D creation in real time.
